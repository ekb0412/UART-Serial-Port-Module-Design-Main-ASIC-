# UART Half Duplex Serial Port Module Design

<div style="text-align: justify">UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a type of serial communication device that is used to transmit and receive data asynchronously. It operates in half-duplex mode, meaning that data can only be transmitted or received at a time, not both. This means that while one device is transmitting data, the other device can only receive it, and vice versa. UARTs are commonly used in embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, to communicate with other devices or computers.

UARTs are typically controlled by a microcontroller and can be configured to support different data rates, called baud rates, and communication protocols. The most common baud rates are 9600, 19200, and 115200 baud. UARTs have a standard configuration with a transmit pin and a receive pin which are used to transmit and receive data. They also have other pins like Ground, CTS, RTS etc. UARTs are widely used for communication between microcontroller and other devices like PC, Modem, GPS etc.</div>

The topics that are being focused on in this study include an introduction to UART and its various types. The research also delves into the analysis of bitstreams, also known as packet sniffing, in order to understand how data is transferred over a network. The use of finite state machine models is also examined in order to understand how they can be used in digital system design. The study explores the use of digital system design in the context of data transfer and communication. Lastly, simulation results are analyzed in relation to power and speed of data transfer in order to evaluate the performance of the system.<br />
